# Circle Circumvention
In this simple HTML evasion game, drag your mouse across the canvas to maneuver around enemies. The more times you die, the more points you will earn upon respawning. However, the catch is that enemies will spawn faster as well! Can you avoid swarms of endlessly spawning circles?
